# Q. No: 10850

## Question

Write code which uses if-then-else statement to check if a given account balance is greater or lesser than the minimum balance.  
  
Write a class BalanceCheck with public method checkBalance that takes one parameter balance of type double.  
  
Use if-then-else statement and print **Balance is low** if balance is less than **1000**. Otherwise, print **Sufficient balance**.  
  
**Note:** You need not write the **main** method. You can directly write the checkBalance(double balance) method in the BalanceCheck class.  
  
Use System.out.**println**() instead of System.out.**print**().  
  
**Note:** Please don't change the package name.

## Solution
```
package q10850;

class BalanceCheck{
        public void checkBalance(double balance){
                if(balance < 1000){
                        System.out.println("Balance is low");
                }else{
                        System.out.println("Sufficient balance");
                }
        }


}
```
